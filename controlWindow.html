      Using The Control Window
    </h1>
    <h2>
      Setup
    </h2>
    <p class="h2">
      In order to use the "Control Window" feature, you first need to create a bookmark with a specific url. You will click this bookmark when you want to control the original snake tab from another website. You will need to click this bookmark every time you load a new page or reload the page.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Creating The Bookmark
    </h3>
    <ol class="h3">
      <li>Right click on the bookmark's bar.</li>
      <li>Click on "Add page".</li>
      <li>Set the name to what you would like to be displayed on your bookmark's bar.</li>
      <li>Copy and paste the following into the "address" field.</li>
    </ol>
    <div class="codeBox h3">
      javascript:document.onkeydown = function(e) { window.opener.postMessage(e.code, '*'); }
    </div>
